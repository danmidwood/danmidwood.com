description: I made a game

I took part in the Best of British game hack one weekend in the summer of 2012. Before this I wasn't a games developer, and I hadn't had any experience with mobile development. So, why did I take part? Well, because it was held at Mind Candy and because there were some awesome people there.

The theme of the weekend was "Summer Sports", some may think that this was a trademark skirting play on the Olympic Games fever, but I'm sure it was only a coincidence.

The game hack was all in Unity, I wrote my code in UnityScript but soon realised that everyone else was using C#. Unity was new to me, but I soon picked it up with the help of others around me.

I built a Hammer Toss game, the other hackathoners made some pretty sweet games, and their awesomeness puts mine to shame somewhat. But I did it and it was great fun.

The game is called Best of British Summer Sports and can be found in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/best-of-british-summer-sports/id559912898?mt=8) now.


The purpose of the hack was to spread the word of Best of British and give publicity to the indie developers taking part. I didn't have a brand or anything else to promote so I made up an Awesomesaurus games and drew a silly logo. My image composition skills are not great, but my logo ended up a little less bad than I feared. Here it is.
