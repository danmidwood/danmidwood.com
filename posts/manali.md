On June 3rd (happy birthday mam) the [Shimla][1] festival began. This lasts (I think) for a full week. Unfortunately, all the rooms in Shimla had been pre-booked. Therefore I was evicted from mine. Judging from all the backpack wielding people strolling though the town I can say I was not the only one.  
  
I was planning to leave the next day so I didn't think it was too much trouble to leave a day early instead. I went to the tourist office to get a ticket for a nice bus (the local buses are a bit grotty). The bus wasn't due until 21:40 so I still had a full day in Shimla.  
  
In Shimla there is not much to do. There are plenty of shops, a few restaurants and a couple of cafes. So I drunk a few teas and a few coffees and ate too much food.  
  
Later that night I was not feeling so well so, after collecting my bag from the YMCA, I went to a pub. I met some people who were living in Shimla for the next few months with completing an MCSE course. One of them was from Leeds and he thought I was from Liverpool. I didn't realise my accent had gone [scouse][2].  
  
I got on the bus and did not sleep and did not feel good. In the morning we got off the bus in [Manali][3]. I struck up a conversation with a fellow passenger. He was called Edan and Israeli and going to Vashist so we shared a rickshaw.  
  
We found a place called Blue * Cafe with rooms available at a cheap rs100. I had some breakfast and met some more people and then went to bed until 6pm.  
  
After I woke I was hungry so went to eat. There are lots of Israeli travellers here (I think it's because of the [charas][4]) and therefore lots of restaurants offering Israeli food so I had some hummous.  
  
Afterwards I went to a hotel that was showing [Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels][5] and watched that. There are lots of apple trees around Manalia, the apples are not yet in season but there is plenty of tasty apple juice to be had so I drank that instead of beer. After the film I watched Rafael Nadal beat Lleyton Hewitt. Then I paid and went to throw up in the toilet.  
  
After that I went back to the hotel and went to bed.  
  
The next day I went into Manali (3.5km from Vashist where I am staying) and had a stroll around. I met an Indian guy called Rikki and he invited me to his flat for beer later. I was still a bit ill so didn't drink but played some cards and won lots and it was fun. He offered to take me to a waterfall the next day so I said ok.  
  
The next day we went to the waterfall, it was beautiful (see pictures).  
  
After that I wondered over to Old Manali via a park which was also beautiful (see pictures). There were lots of pine trees and big stones that I'm not sure whether I should call rocks or boulders. I think rock is the more British choice.  
  
I wondered up into old Manali which was quite nice. I had some green tea and then went back to Vashist. On the way I met a guy called Des, he was a Londoner and he thought I was scouse. I'm worried...  
  
I got back to Blue* and then went over to Rikkis flat and we had some beer and played some cards. It turned out that his boss was there and they are in the gem / jewellery business. It's a well known scam but I played along because they were giving me beer and food and then I went home. (I didn't buy the gems.)  
  
On today I got up and lazied around downstairs in the cafe with Edan for a bit then I went out to the park and to Old Manali and had some more green tea and then played on the internet looking at [Leeds Festival][6] lineup and then it is now.  
  
Enjoy the pictures.
