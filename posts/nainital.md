I crossed the border back to [India][1] on Saturday 26th May, I was meant to go early but when I got up I turned on the tv and [Teenwolf][2] was on on the movie channel so it made me late.  
  
Crossing was pretty easy, there is a river along the border with a huge bridge for me to walk over. I saw a man on a rickshaw headed towards [Nepal][3] so we waved at each other, which was nice.  
  
I went from the border to [Nainital][4] because I had heard that it was beautiful and I'd been told I must go. There wasn't much to do there but the lake (Tal means lake) was a beautiful and so I had three days there.  
  
I could have stayed longer but it was also very expensive. I paid a lot of rupees for a not very nice room.  
  
There wasn't much to do there so there isn't so much to write. I walked around the lake a couple of times and sat in some cafes. The highlight of my time there was finishing [100 Years of Solitude][5]. It was an ace book, I read the last page 5 times.  
  
I left on Monday May 28 towards Dehra Dun, 2 months since my flight from London.
