description: Who is Dan Midwood
---

I am a software developer. By day you will find me at [Mind Candy](http://www.mindcandy.com) in London, playing around with Scala and Java. 

In my spare time I battle iOS development as part of [Darkest Timeline Studios](http://darkesttimelinestudios.com/).

And, in my spare spare time I write Clojure. 

When I take a break from coding I also enjoy fine ales, running, [Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com/) and [beards](http://blog.dakotamcfadzean.com/2013/01/16/the-dailies-740/).
