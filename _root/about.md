description: Who is Dan Midwood
---

I'm a software developer, currently working at [Mind Candy](http://www.mindcandy.com) in London. 

You can find me on

* Twitter as [@djmidwood](http://twitter.com/djmidwood)
* [Github](http://github.com/danmidwood)
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/119768/dan-midwood)

I don't really blog about anything yet. I'm a big fan of Clojure but I share my time between a variety of languages.

As well as parens I also enjoy fine ales, [Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com/) and [beards](http://blog.dakotamcfadzean.com/2013/01/16/the-dailies-740/).
