### The unplanned plan

I decided to leave Mind Candy, it's an idea that had been swirling around my head for a while, but it was also one I didn't forsee being expedited such as it was. I announced my decision at the end of summer and then two months later, I was out and free, and also jobless.

Being in full time employment has been my default for what feels like a long time. Yeah, I've taken time off in between jobs but never more than a week or three. But handing in my notice, I was feeling burned out and unwilling to rush into the next thing. I decided to take some time out, enjoy unemployment and the opportunities it would bring.

I faced the usual questions from friends and colleagues about my plans, the official line was that I'd be working on my own projects, but it was also a time to relax, recover and just start enjoying life again.

The first week out of employment was a holiday, the required do-nothing break. Still at home, but with writing software postponed in favor of running, cooking, reading and simply doing nothing. After that I begun work on a new project, one that I'd been planning for a while but hadn't had the time to make an impact. Maybe I'll provide more details in another post one day.

Previously my style had been far on the un side of healthy (eating dinner in the office, grabbing something quick or ordering a pizza on my journey home, drinking beer and pretending it was a meal), but now I had time to dedicate to cooking and I was going to take it. It wasn't all healthy (I made a lot of pies), but it was all much more natural and "known" food.

I spent a few weeks working on the new project, for maybe three or four days a week and somewhere between three and eighteen hours per day. The mean hours per day was intended to be low but I occasionally missed that intention.

### The planned plan

I decided to leave London. But I hadn't decided where exactly to leave to yet, I considered some other cities in the UK but then ruled them out, then other cities in Europe and ruled those out too. Casting my thoughts a bit wider, I started to look at Buenos Aires, I had heard about BA's burgeoning tech scene and it appeared to be a good fit.

But then, I thought a bit more, and why go to one place when I can go to many? And soon after I booked a flight to Bogota, Colombia. I didn't have much knowledge of Colombia, just a plan to turn up and discover it. And then a greater plan to head south.

My intentions now are to spend split between travel and work, ~one month traveling, then one month stationary and then repeat, until the end. As I write this I'm a few days from leaving Colombia, I have an apartment booked in Quito, Ecuador right by a [5.5 kmÂ² park](http://www.getquitoecuador.com/quito-cultural-attractions/quito_metropolitan_park.html "Quito Metropolitan Park") and just in time for Christmas, New Years and a month of coding, cooking and running.

btw: I've started a [South America blog](http://sablog.danmidwood.com/ "South America Travel Blog") to document my travels, it's aimed at a family audience so won't be techy.
