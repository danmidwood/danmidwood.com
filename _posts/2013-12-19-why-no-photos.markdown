During this trip I made a decision to not take photographs. The decision did have some external prompting, since I was using my iPhone as a camera and that was stolen.

### The Reasons

##### Prefer living in moments to capturing them
Taking photos is a distraction from the thing I want to capture, fumbling around with a camera takes me out of the moment, particularly when I take photo upon photo of the same thing, searching for the perfect image. I'll always prefer a good memory over a tarnished memory and a visual representation of it.

##### Carrying fewer things
I really revel in the "lightness" of carrying fewer things. Cameras are not neccessarily heavy, particularly if you use a compact or a mobile phone. However I still enjoy the simplicity of carrying just a water bottle and a few snacks whilst out on a trek, or being able to easily walk with all of my stuff when traveling between towns.

##### Photographs are not representative
The photos I take would only be the good parts, the outstanding views, beautiful architecture, the magical things; the everyday life and the bad parts would be omitted and under represented, leaving the photographs as a window on a perversely curated "best of" edition of the trip.

### But,

##### Photographs are memories
No they're not.

##### Ok, but they do invoke memories
Alright, that is true. On my last travels a few years ago I took a lot of photos and I have never really looked back through them. But this point is probably the cause of the most unease about my decision, I like to think that my memories alone are enough but I'm not sure about that yet.

##### Don't other people want to see what I've seen?
I guess so, probably. I will still write about places I go and the things I see. If it's important enough for someone to see the things I've seen then I suggest google image search (seriously! What I see is hardly unseen or unique to me), if more than that is needed then they can always take this trip themself.

##### You'll take some pictures though, right?
Maybe. There might be an occasional picture uploaded to Facebook or Twitter, of some food, or some new friends I meet.


### Experimenting

I like to experiment with things in my life and this decision is just another experiement, I've been living it for a few weeks and feeling happy with the progress so far, I can see it becoming permanent.
