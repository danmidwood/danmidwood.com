On Wednesday the 18th I went to Glenary's to drink some tea and read a bit. I ended up talking to a couple of people and one of them was going to the [Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park][1] so then I ended up going to the zoo too.  
My companion was Canadian although living in Leeds and teaching in Cleckheaton which was quite a surprise. I think she was called Christine but I'm not sure.  
  
After days and days of mist and cloud there was none and instead there was a lot of sun. I was taken unprepared and ended up getting a bit sunburnt which was quite stupid.  
  
Anyway, here are some pictures.
