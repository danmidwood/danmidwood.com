The train arrived in [Gaya ][1]around 1am, I got a taxi with an American guy (name forgot) to a hotel called Shanti Lodge. We got a bargain there at 100 Rupees/night.  
  
Bodh Gaya is a [Buddhist][2] pilgrimage site and the village contains ten or so Buddhist temples. The main attraction is the [Mahabodhi temple][3] in the main square which contains a descendant of the original [Bodhi tree][4] under which prince [SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama][5] attained [enlightenment][6]. I sat under the tree for a bit, it was very peaceful but there wasn't any enlightenment for me.  
There wasn't much else in the village apart from the temples but it was a nice placea so I stayed for three days. I left on the 9th towards [Darjeeling][7].  
  
I got a bus from Bodh Gaya to [Patna][8] (4 hours), train from Patna to [New Jalpaiguri][9] (14 hours overnight), rickshaw to [Siliguri][10] (10 min) and then a bus to Darjeeling (3 hours).
